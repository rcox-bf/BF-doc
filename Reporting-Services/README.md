#Reporting Service
The Bluefin Reporting Service API (RSAPI) allows our merchants to securely export the transaction data
for any given day. These reports can be run to verify merchant records of transactions.

Reporting via an API call is one of the many unique and differentiating features of Bluefinâ€™s service
offerings. All data is passed securely from Bluefin through the API, and because no unique cardholder
data is ever passed, the reports are PCI compliant.

Each report from Bluefin can be generated with comma delimited, JSON, or XML output. The reporting
data contains no card numbers, PIN blocks, or card verification values, thus it is PCI compliant.
