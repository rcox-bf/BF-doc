#Scheduling Layer Interface
This section delineates the requests and responses for the
Scheduling Layer API (SLAPI). The scheduling layer enables a
merchant to create a recurring action on behalf of a customer. The
actions that can be performed with the SLAPI are as follows:
* Create a recurring payment
* Modify the schedule of an existing recurring payment
* Modify the amount of a recurring payment
* Cancel the schedule of an existing recurring payment
